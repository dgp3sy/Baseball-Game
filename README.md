## A Note from the Author
This game is in early stages of development, and with baseball there are many rules, regulations, and features I would like to add. My intention for this project is to purely have fun. I worked on many projects over the summer and fall before the main recruiting season in the fall in order to build a portfolio of some of my work. Unfortunately, I felt burnt out on coding after this experience. Furthermore, I spent a semester in a very code intensive class, Advanced Software Development. I want to continue to keep my computer science skills sharp for my future career, but I want to do this in a fun and engaging setting. This project combines two of my favorite interests: Computer Science and Baseball. I have worked on data analysis projects in the past using baseball statistics, but I wanted to do something that would be purely for fun, and not too intensive. Again, I am in the early stages of development with this project, and currently the game only has the opportunity for batting.
