# Baseball-Game
This is a baseball game using pygame and gamebox, a wrapper for pygame

## Getting Started
Please feel free to download this game, and play on your own machine. In order to do this, you need a Python 3 interpreter and need to install the pygame package into that project. Run the following command in your terminal in order to download the appropriate package:
```
pip install pygame
```
In addition, it is crucial that the gamebox.py file and other images remain in the same folder as the rest of the game material. 

## Controls
Control Power: Press "A" to stop the power slider <br />
Control Direction: Press "S" to stop the direction slider <br />
Pitching: After this happens, the ball will comes toward you. If you think the ball is too fast to hit, you can let it pass you and take the ball. <br />
Batting: In order to swing the bat, press Space. If the bat hits the ball, then you will see animation for the ball entering the field of play based on your direction and power that you had set on the slider <br />
Base Running: Once you hit the ball, you will use the arrow keys to run the bases


## Gameplay
The gameplay is more focused on the aspect of batting and offense. First, you will see that the power slider moves from left to right, stop the slider at your desired power level by pressing "A". After this happens, the direction slider will move, you want to aim to stop the slider in the green area in order to not get a foul tip. In order to stop the direction slider, press the "S" key. Then your hit will be animated and you will try to run toward the base while the defense tries to stop you. <br />

## A Note from the Author
This game is in early stages of development, and with baseball there are many rules, regulations, and features I would like to add. My intention for this project is to purely have fun. I worked on many projects over the summer and fall before the main recruiting season in the fall in order to build a portfolio of some of my work. Unfortunately, I felt burnt out on coding after this experience. Furthermore, I spent a semester in a very code intensive class, Advanced Software Development. I want to continue to keep my computer science skills sharp for my future career, but I want to do this in a fun and engaging setting. This project combines two of my favorite interests: Computer Science and Baseball. I have worked on data analysis projects in the past using baseball statistics, but I wanted to do something that would be purely for fun, and not too intensive. Again, I am in the early stages of development with this project, and currently the game only has the opportunity for batting.
