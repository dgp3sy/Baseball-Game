# Baseball-Game
This is a baseball game using pygame and gamebox, a wrapper for pygame

## Getting Started
Please feel free to download this game, and play on your own machine. In order to do this, you need a Python 3 interpreter and need to install the pygame package into that project. Run the following command in your terminal in order to download the appropriate package:
```
pip install pygame
```
In addition, it is crucial that the gamebox.py file and other images remain in the same folder as the rest of the game material. 

## Controls
Pitching: To have the computer pitch the ball, press the "A" key. <br />
Batting: In order to swing the bat, press Space. If the bat hits the ball, then you will see animation for the ball entering the field of play <br />
Base Running: Once you hit the ball, you will use the arrow keys to run the bases

## Sample Gameplay
Here is an example of the game output

## Alternative Gameplay
I am currently developing two versions of the gameplay. The first is what was described above, which focuses more on the entire gameplay of the baseball experience. The second gameplay is more focused on the aspect of batting and offense. If you would like to play this game, download the "different_gameplay" branch and follow the same steps as above. A sample of the alternative gameplay is provided below.

## A Note from the Author
This game is in early stages of development, and with baseball there are many rules, regulations, and features I would like to add. My intention for this project is to purely have fun. I worked on many projects over the summer and fall before the main recruiting season in the fall in order to build a portfolio of some of my work. Unfortunately, I felt burnt out on coding after this experience. Furthermore, I spent a semester in a very code intensive class, Advanced Software Development. I want to continue to keep my computer science skills sharp for my future career, but I want to do this in a fun and engaging setting. This project combines two of my favorite interests: Computer Science and Baseball. I have worked on data analysis projects in the past using baseball statistics, but I wanted to do something that would be purely for fun, and not too intensive. Again, I am in the early stages of development with this project, and currently the game only has the opportunity for batting.
