# Baseball-Game
This is a baseball game using pygame and gamebox, a wrapper created by Luther Tychonievich at the University of Virginia

## Getting Started
Please feel free to download this game, and play on your own machine. In order to do this, you need a Python 3 interpreter and need to install the pygame package into that project. Run the following command in your terminal in order to download the appropriate package:
'''
pip install pygame. 
'''
In addition, it is crucial that the gamebox.py file and other images remain in the same folder as the rest of the game material. 

## Controls
Pitching: To have the computer pitch the ball, press the "A" key. <br />
Batting: In order to swing the bat, press Space. If the bat hits the ball, then you will see animation for the ball entering the field of play
## Sample Gameplay
Here is an example of the game output

## Liscense
This project is open source. Feel free to use, reuse, adapt, and modify the code. I use a wrapper for pygame method, in which the author asks the following: "This code is the original work of Luther Tychonievich, who releases it into the public domain. As a courtesy, Luther would appreciate it if you acknowledged him in any work that benefited from this code."

## A Note from the Author
This game is in early stages of development, and with baseball there are many rules, regulations, and features I would like to add. My intention for this project is to purely have fun. I worked on many projects over the summer and fall before the main recruiting season in the fall in order to build a portfolio of some of my work. Unfortunately, I felt burnt out on coding after this experience. Furthermore, I spent a semester in a very code intensive class, Advanced Software Development. I want to continue to keep my computer science skills sharp for my future career, but I want to do this in a fun and engaging setting. This project combines two of my favorite interests: Computer Science and Baseball. I have worked on data analysis projects in the past using baseball statistics, but I wanted to do something that would be purely for fun, and not too intensive. Again, I am in the early stages of development with this project, and currently the game only has the opportunity for batting.
